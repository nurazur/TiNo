# SHT3x
## Arduino library for Sensirion temperature and humidity sensors SHT30, SHT31 & SHT35.
The light version, modiofied by nurazur 2018 for use in mobile Sensors (Code reduction to the bare minimum) and for SoftwareWire
Check for /examples for examples of different use cases.  

The datasheet I followed is:  
https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/2_Humidity_Sensors/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Datasheet_digital.pdf  
For more simple version check the SimpleSHT3x library.  

The constructor structure:  
SHT3x(    int Address = 0x44, //I2C device address, 0x44 or 0x45  
        ValueIfError Value = Zero, //What to return in case of errors. Zero or PrevValue  
        uint8_t HardResetPin = 255, //Number of pin RESET connected to (input from 100 to 255 if not used)  
        SHT3xSensor SensorType = SHT30, //Sensor type, SHT30, SHT31 or SHT35.  
        SHT3xMode Mode=Single_HighRep_ClockStretch //Operation mode , look for "enum SHT3xMode"  
); 

Do not forget about the UpdateData() method: this method polls sensors.


### Supports:  
    Temperature data at Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit scales.  
    Relative humidity data.  
    Absolute humidity data at Torr, mm Hg, Pa, bar, technical and standard atmosphere, psi scales.  
    Data integrity (by CRC8 algorithm) (datasheet/section 4.12).  
    Temperature, relative and absolute humidity tolerances (in dependence from measured values)  
    Calibration (linear) of temperature and humidity data by factors or by reverse sensor values (2 points)  
    Heater On/Off (integrated to SHT3x sensor) (datasheet/section 4.10)  
    Different sensor actions modes (datasheet/section 4.3)  
    Reset: soft (I2C) and hard (by corresponding pin) (datasheet/section 4.9)  
    
### Do not supports:  
    Action in periodic mode (datasheet/section 4.5)  
    Interrupts (datasheet/section 3.5)  
    
    
    
Note 1: by default, the data from sensor updates not faster, than 2 times a second.
For faster update use SetUpdateInterval(uint32_t UpdateIntervalMillisec); but do not exceed the datasheet values (10 measurments per second (100 ms)) because of sensor self-heating (datasheet/section 4.5, at the end of Table 9)  

Note 2: The sensor type affects the tolerance values only.
